# 1. Background, History and some Basics

* C++ is a superset of C, some programs may compile in C but not in C++

*More into the basic structure of C programs:*

* **Header file**: 
  *  file with extension .h which contains C function declarations and macro definitions to be shared between several source files.
  *  the `#` indicates the [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) handles the inclusion (a preprocessor directive). This involves interpolating the actual code when specific lib related function calls are made(?)
  * [ double quotes vs angle brackets](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3162067): 
     *  If the filename is enclosed within double quotes, the search path is expanded to include the current source directory. Double quotes does more by looking into the current dir first for name-resolution. 
  *  [more on preprocessing and Macros](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interesting-facts-preprocessors-c/):
     *  macros can be defined constants or take in function-like arguments like `#define INCREMENT(x) ++x` which can be used for x of any data type (something like generics in java? tbc)
     *  bracket your function like macros nicely: 
        - `#define MULTIPLY(a, b) (a)*(b)` vs `#define MULTIPLY(a, b) a * b`
     * macros can have concatenation of tokens using `##` (token-pasting operator) e.g. `#define merge(a, b) a##b ` and can use their string literal form using `#a`
     * loads of other macro related caveats...
* **variable declaration:** 
  *  in the C program, no variable can be used without being declared. Also in a C program, the variables are to be declared before any operation in the function. 
*  **main function declaration** :
   *  [`int main(void) { /* ... */ }`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-int-main-int-mainvoid/), where you indicate the input param type is better method signature but either works. In C, if a function signature doesn’t specify any argument, it means that the *function can be called with any number of parameters or without any parameters*. These nuances are inconsequential in C++, will just lead to a syntax error.
   *  can define as: `int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { /* ... */ }`
   *  return type will always be an int. [other main function stuff](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fine-write-void-main-cc/)
  
* **different compilers give different behaviours, so to standarise, we follow the style of C standard (currently C11)**: 
  * example: 
    ```c
    #include<stdio.h> 
    int main() 
    { 
        int i = 1; 
        printf("%d %d %d\n", i++, i++, i); 
        return 0; 
    } 

        // output: 
        // ========
        // 2 1 3 - using g++ 4.2.1 on Linux.i686
        // 1 2 3 - using SunStudio C++ 5.9 on Linux.i686
        // 2 1 3 - using g++ 4.2.1 on SunOS.x86pc
        // 1 2 3 - using SunStudio C++ 5.9 on SunOS.x86pc
        // 1 2 3 - using g++ 4.2.1 on SunOS.sun4u
        // 1 2 3 - using SunStudio C++ 5.9 on SunOS.sun4u
    ```

* **data-type related stuff**:
  * an `int` has width of 32 bits (1 signed + 31 bits)

* **program error signals**, as in OS-related comms b/w processes. 
    * signals(generated by kernel, handled by process) vs interrupts(generated by processor, handled by kernel).  Error signals generally causes termination of the program and a core dump file is created named core, which stores the state of the process at the moment of termination. This file can be investigated using debugger to know the cause of program termination.
* **escape sequences** 
    - entire charset is your 256 Ascii +  ESCAPE chars
    - behaviour varies based on your C compiler. 
* **line splicing:** 
    ```c
    // C program to illustrate the concept of Line splicing. 
    #include <stdio.h> 
    int main() 
    { 
        // Line Splicing\ 
        printf("Hello GFG\n"); 
        printf("welcome"); 
        return (0); 
    } 
    // o/p: welcome
    ```

* **c tokens, keywords and identifiers** 
  * *identifier* refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc.
    * may start with an underscore
  * `const` aka literals format: `const data_type variable_name; (or) const data_type *variable_name;`
  * Strings: arrays of chars, delimited by a null value `\0` 
    ```c
    char string[20] = “geeksforgeeks”; // 20bytes of mem aldy allocated for storing that str
    char string [] = “geeksforgeeks”;  // mem allocation will be done at execution time
    ```

* example compilation: ` $ gcc –Wall filename.c –o filename` to create the executable
  * `-Wall` enables all compiler's warnings


* **stuff to fanboy about for C:**
  * It can be used for low-level programming, such as scripting for drivers and kernels and it also supports functions of high-level programming languages, such as scripting for software applications etc.
  * modular with free movement of data across functions
  * useful when working with embedded systems and their APIs


# 2. Variable Decl, Defn and Scope

just to focus on some interesting/new keywords:

**declaration** involves setting aside some memory space and **definition** involves assigning variables to that addr. 

Variables may be **`static`** i.e. retains value b/w multiple function calls is known as static variable.

**Automatic Variables**: all vars declared inside the block, has associated `auto` keyword. basically your locally defined var, just explicitly declared. 

**External Variables**: for sharing b/w multiple C files ("package level"), `extern` keyword is used to share b/w multiple C files. basically a global var

**Constants**: must be initialised during their declaration! `const` is also used in [ref to a pointer](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/const-qualifier-in-c/)

**Void**: useful in the [context of pointers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/void-pointer-c-cpp/), kiv for another time



## basic keywords example 

  ```c

  #include <stdio.h> 
    
  // declaring and initializing an extern variable 
  extern int x = 9;  
    
  // declaring and initializing a global variable 
  // simply int z; would have initialized z with 
  // the default value of a global variable which is 0 
  int z=10; 
    
  // using typedef to give a short name to long long int  
  // very convenient to use now due to the short name 
  typedef long long int LL;  
    
  // function which prints square of a no. and which has void as its 
  // return data type 
  void calSquare(int arg)  
  { 
      printf("The square of %d is %d\n",arg,arg*arg); 
  } 
    
  // Here void means function main takes no parameters 
  int main(void)  
  { 
      // declaring a constant variable, its value cannot be modified 
      const int a = 32;  
    
      // declaring a  char variable 
      char b = 'G'; 
    
      // telling the compiler that the variable z is an extern variable  
      // and has been defined elsewhere (above the main function) 
      extern int z; 
    
      LL c = 1000000; 
    
      printf("Hello World!\n"); 
    
      // printing the above variables 
      printf("This is the value of the constant variable 'a': %d\n",a); 
      printf("'b' is a char variable. Its value is %c\n",b); 
      printf("'c' is a long long int variable. Its value is %lld\n",c); 
      printf("These are the values of the extern variables 'x' and 'z'"
      " respectively: %d and %d\n",x,z); 
    
      // value of extern variable x modified 
      x=2;  
    
      // value of extern variable z modified 
      z=5;  
    
      // printing the modified values of extern variables 'x' and 'z' 
      printf("These are the modified values of the extern variables"
      " 'x' and 'z' respectively: %d and %d\n",x,z); 
    
      // using a static variable 
      printf("The value of static variable 'y' is NOT initialized to 5 after the "
              "first iteration! See for yourself :)\n"); 
    
      while (x > 0) 
      { 
          static int y = 5; 
          y++; 
          // printing value at each iteration 
          printf("The value of y is %d\n",y); 
          x--; 
      } 
    
      // print square of 5 
      calSquare(5);  
    
      printf("Bye! See you soon. :)\n"); 
    
      return 0; 
  } 

  ```

## Scoping in C

**mind = blown.**

**C variables Statically(Lexically) Scoped**

i.e. binding of a variable can be determined by program text and is independent of the run-time function call stack. [see example here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/g-fact-16/)

[wiki page on scoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)). Dynamic scoping relies on execution context. Some Scripting languages, template languages... usedynamic scoping. 


## [Internal and External Linkage in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/internal-linkage-external-linkage-c/)

**Scope vs Linkage:**
Linkage thus allows you to couple names together on a per file basis, scope determines visibility of those names.
Scope is a property handled by compiler while linkage is a property handled by linker.
Until compilation, a var can be decscribed by it's scope, upon compiling, the linking process starts and linkage comes into play. The compilation process includes a *linking stage* actually. 

Linkage is a property that describes how variables should be linked by the linker. Should a variable be available for another file to use? Should a variable be used only in the file declared? Both are decided by linkage.

**Internal Linkage:**
  *  An identifier implementing internal linkage is not accessible outside the translation unit it is declared in.
     *  Any identifier within the unit can access an identifier having internal linkage. It is implemented by the keyword `static`. An internally linked identifier is stored in initialized or uninitialized segment of RAM.
  *  Another property of internal linkage is that it is only implemented when the variable has global scope, and all constants are by default internally linked.
  *  an internally linked var is passed by copy! that's why can reuse names for helper functions that are translation-unit specific
  *  

### Linkers and Name Resolution: how to resolve global symbols?

***caution: don't take linkers lightly, as the bugs due to misunderstanding of how they work are freaking difficult to find***

There's a notion of **strong and weak symbols** (something that the compiler determines at compile time, before passing it on to the assembler and the assembler encodes into the symbol table of the relocatable object file), based on which the following rules are adhered to when dealing with multiple defined symbols: 

> Rule 1: Multiple strong symbols (with same variable name) are not allowed.  
> Rule 2: Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols, choose the strong symbol.  
> Rule 3: Given multiple weak symbols, choose any of the weak symbols.

* Notice that the linker normally gives no indication that it has detected multiple definitions of x.

  ```c
  /* foo3.c */
  #include <stdio.h> 
  void f(void); 
  int x = 15213; 
  int main() 
  { 
    f(); 
    printf("x = %d\n", x); 
    return 0; 
  } 
    
  /* bar3.c */
  int x; 
  void f() 
  { 
    x = 15212; 
  } 

  // At run time, function f() changes the value of x from 15213 to 15212
  ```

* *The application of rules 2 and 3 can introduce some insidious run-time bugs that are incomprehensible to the unwary programmer, especially if the duplicate symbol definitions have different types.*

  Example : “x” is defined as an int in one module and a double in another.

  ```c
  /*a.c*/
  #include <stdio.h> 
  void b(void);  
    
  int x = 2016; 
  int y = 2017; 
  int main() 
  { 
      b(); 
      printf("x = 0x%x y = 0x%x \n", x, y); 
      return 0; 
  } 
  /*b.c*/
  double x; 
    
  void b() 
  { 
      x = -0.0; 
  } 
  // execution steps / o/p: 
  // $ gcc a.c b.c -o geeksforgeeks
  // $ ./geeksforgeeks
  // x = 0x0 y = 0x80000000
  ```
  This is a subtle and nasty bug, especially because it occurs silently, with no warning from the compilation system, and because it typically manifests itself much later in the execution of the program, far away from where the error occurred. In a large system with hundreds of modules, a bug of this kind is extremely hard to fix, especially because many programmers are not aware of how linkers work. When in doubt, invoke the linker with a flag such as the gcc -fno-common flag, which triggers an error if it encounters multiple defined global symbols.


### Redeclaring Global Var in C

C allows a global var to be declared again when first declaration doesn't initialize the var.

  ```c

  // Program 1 FAILS COMPILATION
  int main() 
  { 
    int x; 
    int x = 5; 
    printf("%d", x); 
    return 0;  
  } 



  // Program 2  PASSES
  int x; 
  int x = 5; 
    
  int main() 
  { 
    printf("%d", x); 
    return 0;  
  } 

  ```

## Making Sense of Complicated Declarations

The general idea is to read things in postfix notation and then try to make sense of it. [some examples here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complicated-declarations-in-c/). smol example: 

* `int (*fp) ();`: 
  - convert above expression to postfix format. For the above example, there is no innermost parenthesis, that’s why, we will print declaration name i.e. `fp`. Next step is, go to right side of expression, but there is nothing on right side of `fp` to parse, that’s why go to left side. On left side we found `*`, now print `*` and come out of parenthesis. We will get postfix expression as below.
  - postfix expression:  `fp * () int` --> read postfix expression from left to right. e.g. fp is pointer to function returning int

* `void (*f[10]) (int, int) `:
  - postfix: `f[10] * (int, int) void` --> f is an array of 10 pointer to function(which takes 2 arguments of type int) returning void

* `int *(*(*arr[5])()) ()`: 
    * postfix: `arr[5] * () * () * int` --> arr is an array of 5 pointers to functions returning pointer to function returning pointer to integer 


# 3. Functions



# 4. Pointers

Pointer Related Symbols:
  * `&`: access mem adress of a variable
  * `*`: 
    * declaration of pointer var
    * **Pointer dereferencing**: access the value stored in the address we use the unary operator (*) that returns the value of the variable located at the address specified by its operand


syntax example: 
  ```c

  // C program to demonstrate use of * for pointers in C 
  #include <stdio.h> 
    
  int main() 
  { 
      // A normal integer variable 
      int Var = 10; 
    
      // A pointer variable that holds address of var. 
      int *ptr = &Var; 
    
      // This line prints value at address stored in ptr. 
      // Value stored is value of variable "var" 
      printf("Value of Var = %d\n", *ptr); 
    
      // The output of this line may be different in different 
      // runs even on same machine. 
      printf("Address of Var = %p\n", ptr); 
    
      // We can also use ptr as lvalue (Left hand 
      // side of assignment) 
      *ptr = 20; // Value at address is now 20 
    
      // This prints 20 
      printf("After doing *ptr = 20, *ptr is %d\n", *ptr); 
    
      return 0; 
  } 
```

[Difference between const char *p, char * const p and const char * const p](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-const-char-p-char-const-p-const-char-const-p/): 

* `const`: can be used as a qualifier on **any** variable. const keyword applies to whatever is immediately to its left. If there is nothing to its left, it applies to whatever is immediately to its right
  * `const char *ptr`:  it's a pointer called `ptr`, to a const char. Can't change the value pointed to by `ptr` but can change the pointer itself:
    ```c
    int main() 
    { 
        char a ='A', b ='B'; 
        const char *ptr = &a; 
          
        //*ptr = b; illegal statement (assignment of read-only location *ptr) 
          
        // ptr can be changed 
        printf( "value pointed to by ptr: %c\n", *ptr); 
        ptr = &b; 
        printf( "value pointed to by ptr: %c\n", *ptr); 
    } 
    ```
    **nb:**  no difference between const char *p and char const *p as both are pointer to a const char and position of ‘*'(asterik) is also same. 
  * `char *const ptr`: is a constant pointer to a non-constant character. So, can't change the ptr, but can change the value that's pointed to by the pointer
    ```c
    int main() 
    { 
        char a ='A', b ='B'; 
        char *const ptr = &a; 
        printf( "Value pointed to by ptr: %c\n", *ptr); 
        printf( "Address ptr is pointing to: %d\n\n", ptr); 
      
        //ptr = &b; illegal statement (assignment of read-only variable ptr) 
      
        // changing the value at the address ptr is pointing to 
        *ptr = b;  
        printf( "Value pointed to by ptr: %c\n", *ptr); 
        printf( "Address ptr is pointing to: %d\n", ptr); 
    } 
    // output: 
    // Value pointed to by ptr: A
    // Address ptr is pointing to: -1443150762

    // Value pointed to by ptr: B
    // Address ptr is pointing to: -1443150762
    ```
  * `const char * const ptr`: constant pointer to a constant character. Can't change the ptr nor the value of the character that it's pointing at



Some more type of pointers: 

* **Dangling Pointers**: pointer points to a mem location that's been deleted/freed
  * created when mem is de-allocated (i.e freed) 
  * when a function uses a local variable, a pointer pointing to that local variable will become a dangling pointer when that local variable is not static
* [**Void pointer**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/void-pointer-c-cpp/): pointer pointing to some mem location that doesn't have a specific type. Any pointer is convertible to a void pointer and hence can point to any value
  * void pointer can't be dereferenced but **can be typecasted into any type**:
      ```c
      // this won't compile, error: Compiler Error: 'void*' is not a pointer-to-object type 
      #include<stdio.h> 
      int main() 
      { 
        int a = 10; 
        void *ptr = &a; 
        printf("%d", *ptr); 
        return 0; 
      } 

      // this will compile, o/p is 10
      #include<stdio.h> 
      int main() 
      { 
        int a = 10; 
        void *ptr = &a; 
        printf("%d", *(int *)ptr); 
        return 0; 
      } 

      ```
    * Void pointers are use **to implement generic functions in C**, [see the comparator for qsort function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparator-function-of-qsort-in-c/) for an example of such generic functions
      * [generic linked lists in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generic-linked-list-in-c-2/). It uses void pointers and functions pointers to get the implementation of a generic linked list! **see the implementation to understand C generics better**
  * can't perform pointer arithmetic on void pointers cuz no concrete value & size
    * but there are are exceptions (mainly due to the compiler used). e.g. GNU's gcc allows pointer arithmetic on void pointers
* [**NULL pointer**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/few-bytes-on-null-pointer-in-c/): points at nothing, i.e. if we don't have an adress to be assigned to a pointer, then assign it to NULL: `int *ptr = NULL;`
  * NULL =/= uninitialized ptr(i.e. **wild pointer**): 
    *  An uninitialized pointer stores an undefined value. A null pointer stores a defined value, but one that is defined by the environment to not be a valid address for any member or object.
  *  NULL vs void ptrs:  Null pointer is a value, while void pointer is a type 
  *  some common purposes of using NULL pointers: 
    1. init a ptr variable without assigning any mem address to it yet
    2. good practice to avoid bugs by checking for a NULL ptr before assgining any mem addr to it
    3. to pass a NULL ptr to a fn argument when we don't want to pass any valid mem addr to it


[How arrays' element accessing is done](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/an-uncommon-representation-of-array-elements/):
  * compiler converts the array operation in pointers before accessing the array elements.
    * e.g. arr[0] would be *(arr + 0) and therefore 0[arr] would be *(0 + arr) and you know that both *(arr + 0) and *(0 + arr) are same
## Pointer Exp and Arithmetic

Since Pointers hold addresses, we can do some arithmetic w them: 

* Incrementing
* Decrementing
* Integer addition to the pointer
* Integer substraction on the pointer
  * also: Subtracting two addresses lets you compute the offset between these two addresses.

  ```c

  // C++ program to illustrate Pointer Arithmetic 
  // in C/C++ 
  #include <bits/stdc++.h> 
    
  // Driver program 
  int main() 
  { 
      // Declare an array 
      int v[3] = {10, 100, 200}; 
    
      // Declare pointer variable 
      int *ptr; 
    
      // Assign the address of v[0] to ptr 
      ptr = v; 
    
      for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) 
      { 
          printf("Value of *ptr = %d\n", *ptr); 
          printf("Value of ptr = %p\n\n", ptr); 
    
          // Increment pointer ptr by 1 
          ptr++; 
      } 
  } 

  // o/p:
  // Value of *ptr = 10
  // Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c710

  // Value of *ptr = 100
  // Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c714

  // Value of *ptr = 200
  // Value of ptr = 0x7ffcae30c718

  ```


**Array names act as pointer constants**, value of the pointer is the addr of the first element. So, if array's name is `val`, then `val` and `&val[0]` are interchangable.

## Double Pointers

just use this example:
  ```c

  #include <stdio.h> 
    
  // C program to demonstrate pointer to pointer 
  int main() 
  { 
      int var = 789; 
    
      // pointer for var 
      int *ptr2; 
    
      // double pointer for ptr2 
      int **ptr1; 
    
      // storing address of var in ptr2 
      ptr2 = &var; 
        
      // Storing address of ptr2 in ptr1 
      ptr1 = &ptr2; 
        
      // Displaying value of var using 
      // both single and double pointers 
      printf("Value of var = %d\n", var ); 
      printf("Value of var using single pointer = %d\n", *ptr2 ); 
      printf("Value of var using double pointer = %d\n", **ptr1); 
      
    return 0; 
  }  

  // output:
  // Value of var = 789
  // Value of var using single pointer = 789
  // Value of var using double pointer = 789
  ```
## [Function Pointers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-pointer-in-c/)

mind = blown.

Well, just pointers to functions. There are some cool caveats to function pointers.

1. function pointers point to code, not data, i.e. function pointers store the start of executable code
2. we don't de-allocate mem using function pointers
3. func ptr's name can be used to get the fn's addr, so can omit the `&` operator to access the address. 
4. can have an array of function pointers
5. can use function pointer in place of switch case:
   
  ```c
  #include <stdio.h> 
  void add(int a, int b) 
  { 
    printf("Addition is %d\n", a+b); 
  } 
  void subtract(int a, int b) 
  { 
    printf("Subtraction is %d\n", a-b); 
  } 
  void multiply(int a, int b) 
  { 
    printf("Multiplication is %d\n", a*b); 
  } 

  int main() 
  { 
    // fun_ptr_arr is an array of function pointers 
    void (*fun_ptr_arr[])(int, int) = {add, subtract, multiply}; 
    unsigned int ch, a = 15, b = 10; 

    printf("Enter Choice: 0 for add, 1 for subtract and 2 "
        "for multiply\n"); 
    scanf("%d", &ch); 

    if (ch > 2) return 0; 

    (*fun_ptr_arr[ch])(a, b); 

    return 0; 
  } 

  // o/p / interaction: 
  // Enter Choice: 0 for add, 1 for subtract and 2 for multiply
  // 2
  // Multiplication is 150 
  ```
6. fn ptrs can be passed as args and returned as output as well! v useful in reducing code redundancy
   
  ```c
  // An example for qsort and comparator 
  #include <stdio.h> 
  #include <stdlib.h> 

  // A sample comparator function that is used 
  // for sorting an integer array in ascending order. 
  // To sort any array for any other data type and/or 
  // criteria, all we need to do is write more compare 
  // functions. And we can use the same qsort() 
  int compare (const void * a, const void * b) 
  { 
  return ( *(int*)a - *(int*)b ); 
  } 

  int main () 
  { 
  int arr[] = {10, 5, 15, 12, 90, 80}; 
  int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]), i; 

  qsort (arr, n, sizeof(int), compare); 

  for (i=0; i<n; i++) 
    printf ("%d ", arr[i]); 
  return 0; 
  } 

```


### Function pointer declarations

Take note of operator precedence when declaring functions. The `()` operator takes precedence over the `*` operator, hence: 
  * `int * foo(int);` --> a function foo that takes in an int and returns a pointer to an int (a function foo with one argument of int type and return value of int * i.e. integer pointer) 
  So, we use the `()` operator to help **bind** the `*` to the function like so: `int (* foo) (int);`

* [this is a really weird example of dereferencing and referencing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dereference-reference-dereference-reference/) basically `*` and `&` cancel each other out. 

### [Pointers and Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-array-array-pointer/)


#### [Pointers vs Arrays](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pointer-vs-array-in-c/)

In general, we treat the use of pointers and array access as similar to each other, with the following differences: 
  * `sizeof()` function returns different things
  * `&` address operator returns different things 
  * initializing a string literal will give different behaviours. 
    * `char *ptr = "abc"`: will generally be read-only mem hence unchangeable string 
    * `char array[] = "abc"`: individual char arr elements can be overwriten 
  * pointers can be assigned a value while arrays cannot
  * we can do pointer arithmetic but not array-related arithmetic
[here's a more detailed description of the differences between pointers and arrays in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-pointer-array-c/)

## [`restrict` keyword](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/restrict-keyword-c/)

This doesn't add functionality, simply allows for some optimisations to be done by the compiler. When we use restrict with a pointer ptr, it tells the compiler that ptr is the only way to access the object pointed by it and compiler doesn’t need to add any additional checks. If the code violates this condition, then the behaviour of that code is undefined

  ```c

  // C program to use restrict keyword. 
  #include <stdio.h> 
    
  // Note that the purpose of restrict is to 
  // show only syntax. It doesn't change anything 
  // in output (or logic). It is just a way for 
  // programmer to tell compiler about an  
  // optimization 
  void use(int* a, int* b, int* restrict c) 
  { 
      *a += *c; 
    
      // Since c is restrict, compiler will 
      // not reload value at address c in 
      // its assembly code. Therefore generated 
      // assembly code is optimized 
      *b += *c;   
  } 
    
  int main(void) 
  { 
      int a = 50, b = 60, c = 70; 
      use(&a, &b, &c); 
      printf("%d %d %d", a, b, c); 
      return 0; 
  } 

  ```

# questions to clarify

1. macros in C are not exactly the same as generics in java? need to read up on generics in C
2. i don't get the syntax for the compare function as in function pointers point 6.
3.
